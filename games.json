    "description" : "Grand Theft Auto III, also known as GTA 3 or GTA III, is the third installment of the Grand Theft Auto series, and was released in 2001. The game is the first of the 3D Universe, and introduced many new features and increased the fan base of the series. It was originally released on the PlayStation 2, PC, and Xbox. GTA III is the first foray into true three-dimensional GTA gameplay, with the player taking control of the game via a third-person perspective, viewed from behind and above the player character, as opposed to the Top-Down Perspective in the earlier Grand Theft Auto 1 and Grand Theft Auto 2 games. The transition from top-down to full 3D has been widely regarded as a great maneuver, proven by its phenomenal sales figures.",
